				<FAQAccordion
					question={`Is FreeInvoicing right for my business?`}
					answer={
						<p>
							FreeInvoicing can be used by anyone providing services. It can be used by freelancers,
							lawyers and other professionals too. It can also be used to create export invoices if you
							have customers outside India.<br />
							FreeInvoicing currently does not cater to<br />
							1. Businesses with inventory, and <br />
							2. Large suppliers who are governed by e-invoicing norms.<br />
							Weâ€™ve created 2 min videos explaining various use cases. Head over to our Resources Page or
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiCiLXvhHwu5hDLwfneJJgg"> Youtube Channel</a> to
							know more.

				<FAQAccordion
					question={`I am not registered under GST. Can I still use FreeInvoicing?`}
					answer={
						<p>
							Absolutely! FreeInvoicing allows you to select if you are GST registered or not. If you are
							not GST registered,
							<br />
							1. Your invoices will be titled "Bill of Supply" and not Tax Invoice,<br />
							2. There will be no taxes on the invoice; it will simply mention the total amount due,{' '}
							<br />
							3. Your invoices will be serially numbered, and also digitally signed .<br />
							Further, when you qualify for registration, we can help you get your GST Number, for free.

							access your data is you.

							We are not in the business of monetising your data.
